# Generative Modeling

1. Autoencoders for data compression, data denoising, etc. using Python3.X and TensorFlow 2.X
2. Autoencoders for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using _Functional API_ and _Model Sublcassing_ methods in TensorFlow 2.X
3. Analysis and visualization of trained encoder's _latent space_ as a precursor to _VAE_
4. Variational Autoencoders - MNIST and CIFAR10 in PyTorch and TensorFlow2.x
5. To read my blog explaining a CNN based VAE for CIFAR-10 with TensorFlow-2.8 can be read [here](https://medium.com/@arjun.majumdar/variational-autoencoder-cifar-10-tf2-9ed1155771e1)
